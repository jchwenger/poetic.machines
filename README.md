Language and textuality are one of the fundamental and most exciting domains of human expression, in the arts and beyond. Practitioners of all kinds (writers of course, but also performers, musicians, visual artists, film makers, game designers, etc.) engage with language in their practices. What is more, one of the defining technological advances of our time, Large Language Models, was achieved by applying machine learning techniques to textual corpora.

In this course, students will build foundational knowledge and command of programming concepts (variables, conditionals, functions, loops, data structures, etc.) with a special emphasis on text and language. This will involve learning how to handle language using programming (using Python and JavaScript), developing abilities to build creative pipelines and/work visually with text, as well as experimenting with chat interfaces, as well as various LLM concepts and techniques (prompting, word embeddings, fine-tuning).

The creative side of the course will draw inspiration from various movements, including the Oulipo (Ouvroir de Littérature Potentielle, combining writing and constrained procedures); Visual Poetry (including Visual and Artistic works using text); Concrete Poetry; Conceptual Writing, as well as works using found/existing text. Throughout the term we will create small prototypes applying creative constraints involving various methods through the use of Python/p5.js as well as applying algorithmic thinking to creative processes using only pen and paper. Experiments in the students’ native tongue, as well as multilingual ones, will be encouraged!

This course is open to those who feel comfortable with writing as well as those who usually avoid it. Students will be free to choose to use their own writing, to work from existing materials (including literary works, articles, instruction manuals, tweets, slogans, logos, etc.), or experiment with the synthetic output of LLMs.

*Poetic Machines* hopes to encourage opening up the creative possibilities of working between and beyond languages, from producing multilingual pieces to treating text as image and image as text.
