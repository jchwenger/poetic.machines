A function creates a scope, i.e. an \"inside world\", which is partially separate from the \"outside world\" that surrounds it. This has important implications for working with variables, since a variable defined *inside* a function (called \"local\" variables) does not exist outside it, even if the ones defined *outside* the function (\"global\" variables) are accessible from inside it.
