# Lab 4

In each lab, we encourage you to go over the lecture material (the Jupyter notebooks), run things for yourself, try and modify the examples given, think about how they work, and how you could modify them to make them more familiar or useful to you.

## Analogue Experiment: Poetic Mechanisms

1. Look back at these early examples of kinetic poetry and find or choose one thing you found interesting about them. Think about how each poem moves, how these movements affect our perception of the text. Think of movements that are not used in these works. Pick three movements you would be interested in exploring in your own kinetic sculpture.
2. Choose one of those movements and find 5 or more words to associate with it.
3. Using your chosen movement and words, sketch out your own poetry machine with pen and paper or equivalent devices.

## Programming practice

In this lab, our focus is:
- to have a look at the role of:
  - `translate` ("move the canvas origin – the `0, 0` point – somewhere") and
  - `rotate` ("turn the canvas around the origin" by a certain amount"), as well as
  - `push` ("save the sketch state – current translate, rotate, and styles") and
  - `pop` ("return to the last saved state, before the last call to `push`"),  
  since those are very useful for all kinds of animations, and to keep your code tidier;
- to introduce the notion of **control flow** or **conditionals** (`if`, `elif` and `else`), as well as the importance of logical operators (`and` and `or`);
- to understand the importance of the **modulo** (`%`) operator to control the tempo/speed of animations;
- to introduce the parameters helper, that allows us to change sketch variables using a GUI!

## Inspirations

One of the key figures for ideas here is Jörg Piringer: a huge amount of works is available on his [website](https://joerg.piringer.net/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@joergpiringer) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jpiringer/).
