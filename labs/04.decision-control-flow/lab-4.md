# Lab 4

In each lab, we encourage you to go over the lecture material (the Jupyter notebooks), run things for yourself, try and modify the examples given, think about how they work, and how you could modify them to make them more familiar or useful to you.

## Programming practice

In this lab, our main focus is to introduce the notion of **control flow** or **conditionals** (`if`, `elif` and `else`).

## Analogue Experiment: Poetic Mechanisms

1. Look back at these early examples of kinetic poetry and find or choose one thing you found interesting about them. Think about how each poem moves, how these movements affect our perception of the text. Think of movements that are not used in these works. Pick three movements you would be interested in exploring in your own kinetic sculpture. 
2. Choose one of those movements and find 5 or more words to associate with it. 
3. Using your chosen movement and words, sketch out your own poetry machine with pen and paper or equivalent devices.
