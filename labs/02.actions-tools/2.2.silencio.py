# IDEAS, to make it your own, (#BreakTheSilence!):
# - Change the colour of the words.
# - Change the placement of the words.
# - Change the typeface.
# - Change the words themselves.
# - At this stage it is encouraged to go wild: add/remove some of the lines,
#   experiment with superposing/mashing text, or even add some of the rotation
#   logic from `animation.py`?!
# - You could take screenshots along the way to document your destruction of
#   silencio!

# IMPORTANT NOTE: see?, here we have a static sketch with a draw. As it is, it
# could be rewritten by eliminating the `def draw():` and placing everything in
# `setup`. Of course, the capability of `draw` could be taken advantage of, and
# some animation could be introduced: can you make it move???
