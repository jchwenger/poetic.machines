# Two notes:
# - This is a common example in Computer Science: the simplest possible program
#   you can write (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)
# - See the '#' sign at the beginning of the line? This is a *comment*: it
#   means this line will not be considered a line of code, and will 'do'
#   nothing. You can use them to add explanations!

#Â This line, no '#', does something, telling Python to say: "Hello # World!"
print("Hello World!")
