# Lab 1

## 1. Installation

In this lab, the technical goals are:
- Clone the course repository using git or download it as a zip.
- Install a code editor if you do not have one (Visual Studio Code is recommended); In VSCode, the recommended plugins are: Jupyter; Python; Markdown All In One.
- Follow the instructions in the `README.md` of the repository to install `miniforge` and:
  - create an environment for the course (called e.g. `poetic.machines`);
  - activate the environment;
  - use `pip` (or `mamba`) to install the required software.
- Once this is done, check that you can:
  - Run a `py5canvas` sketch;
  - Open and run a Jupyter Notebook, and familiarise yourself with the interface (code and markdown cells).

## 2. Analogue practice

The following work is by Ilse Garnier, ‘Jeu de Cubes’, from *Puzzle-Alphabet*, 1988:

Using this as inspiration (feel free to look into other pieces in her book), and the given paper templates, create a cube poem of your own.
