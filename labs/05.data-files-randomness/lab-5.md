# Lab 5

In each lab, we encourage you to go over the lecture material (the Jupyter notebooks), run things for yourself, try and modify the examples given, think about how they work, and how you could modify them to make them more familiar or useful to you.

## Programming practice

## Analogue Experiment: Poetic Findings

1. Look back on today’s session on found poetry and conceptual writing. Think about how the poets in the examples shown here repurpose existing language and how they select, reframe, or transform it into something new.
2. In groups of four, leave the room and search around the university to find poems. These could come from posters, signs, books, overheard material, graffiti, or any written material you encounter. Collect as many as you can by taking or photographing them. When you return with your findings, arrange your collected texts into a small “found poetry collection.
3. Present your collection to another group. Then, exchange your poems and carry out an action on the collection you are given. — for example, remixing, reordering, reading aloud, or transforming them into a new collaborative piece.
