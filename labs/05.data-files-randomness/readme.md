# Lab 5

In each lab, we encourage you to go over the lecture material (the Jupyter notebooks), run things for yourself, try and modify the examples given, think about how they work, and how you could modify them to make them more familiar or useful to you.

## Analogue Experiment: Poetic Findings

1. Look back on today’s session on found poetry and conceptual writing. Think about how the poets in the examples shown here repurpose existing language and how they select, reframe, or transform it into something new.
2. In groups of four, leave the room and search around the university to find poems. These could come from posters, signs, books, overheard material, graffiti, or any written material you encounter. Collect as many as you can by taking or photographing them. When you return with your findings, arrange your collected texts into a small “found poetry collection.
3. Present your collection to another group. Then, exchange your poems and carry out an action on the collection you are given. — for example, remixing, reordering, reading aloud, or transforming them into a new collaborative piece.

## Programming practice

In this lab, we are exploring *randomness* and the interaction with external data:
- The first sketch shows how to use random numbers to bring animation to our canonical example, Gomringer's 'silencio'.
- The second sketch demonstrates how to use Perlin noise, and perhaps how this might be used to create interesting animations.
- The third sketch loads a pre-formatted text file, extracts from [Yoko Ono's *Grapefruit*](https://monoskop.org/images/archive/6/64/20190320203953%21Ono_Yoko_Grapefruit_A_Book_of_Instructions_and_Drawings_2000.pdf), and uses randomness to pick lines from various texts and recombines them into a new instruction!
- The fourth and fifth sketches are literally just technical demos showing you how to load an image or a video.
