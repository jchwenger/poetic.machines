# Lab 7

In each lab, we encourage you to go over the lecture material (the Jupyter notebooks), run things for yourself, try and modify the examples given, think about how they work, and how you could modify them to make them more familiar or useful to you.

## Analogue experiment: Poetic Chats

1. Look back at the chatbot examples from today’s lecture. Notice one feature or rule you found interesting. Think about how that rule shaped the chatbot’s responses. Now, invent a chatbot of your own with a clear rule or constraint. Consider how this rule will guide what the chatbot can or cannot say.
2. In pairs, take turns impersonating your chatbot while your partner interacts with you. See if they can guess your chatbot’s rule, and reflect on whether it was easy or hard to maintain.
3. Write down three changes you could make to create a second version of your chatbot.

## Programming practice

This week, we are looking at synthetic texts and chatbots. There are three ways in which you can explore local models using `Ollama`:
- Using the built-in chat in the terminal (beyond choosing the kind of model you want to use – see the [library](https://ollama.com/search) –, you can also drill into how you can customise models by changing the system prompt and its template: look at the modelfiles link below);
- One of the sketches does not even use `py5canvas`, and just demonstrates how you could built a custom chatbot using Python;
- Finally, the second sketch shows how you can use a **class** to integrate text and animation in one sketch.
