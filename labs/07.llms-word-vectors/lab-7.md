# Lab 7

In each lab, we encourage you to go over the lecture material (the Jupyter notebooks), run things for yourself, try and modify the examples given, think about how they work, and how you could modify them to make them more familiar or useful to you.

## Programming practice

## Analogue experiment: Poetic Chats

1. Look back at the chatbot examples from today’s lecture. Notice one feature or rule you found interesting. Think about how that rule shaped the chatbot’s responses. Now, invent a chatbot of your own with a clear rule or constraint. Consider how this rule will guide what the chatbot can or cannot say.
2. In pairs, take turns impersonating your chatbot while your partner interacts with you. See if they can guess your chatbot’s rule, and reflect on whether it was easy or hard to maintain.
3. Write down three changes you could make to create a second version of your chatbot.
