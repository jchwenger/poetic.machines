# Lab 6

In each lab, we encourage you to go over the lecture material (the Jupyter notebooks), run things for yourself, try and modify the examples given, think about how they work, and how you could modify them to make them more familiar or useful to you.

## Programming practice

In this lab, we are focussing on two fundamental ways in which we can interact with a computer: the **mouse** and the **keyboard**.

## Analogue Experiment: Poetic Interactions

1. Look back at the interactive poetry activities from today’s lecture. Identify one mode of interaction you enjoyed or found engaging. Think about how input, output, and participation worked in that example.
2. Now, design your own analogue poetry game for a single participant. Decide what the inputs will be (what the user does), what the outputs will be (what the game produces), and how the interaction will unfold.
3. In pairs, playtest your games. One person acts as the **interface** (following the game’s rules and producing outputs), while the other acts as the **user** (providing inputs and interacting with the game). Then swap roles so both partners experience being interface and user.
